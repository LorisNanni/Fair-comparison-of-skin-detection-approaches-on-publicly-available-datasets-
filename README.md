Fair comparison of skin detection approaches on publicly available datasets 

The CNN  trained  for skin segmentation are available here: https://zenodo.org/record/3842237#.XsspSWgzY2w

Notice that the two .rar files ToolSurvey2017.part1.rar & ToolSurvey2017.part2.rar  are related to a preliminary version of the paper where the 
Deeplabv3+ net was not used. The code for training Deeplabv3+ is available in the file CodeDeepLabV3R50.rar
To implement the method Vote4 of the paper you should change the vote rule of “ToolSurvey2017.part1.rar & ToolSurvey2017.part2.rar ” considering the weights of Vote4 reported in the paper.
